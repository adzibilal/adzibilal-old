## Adzi Bilal Maulana
_Frontend Developer_

Hey there! I'm a skilled Frontend Developer who loves creating awesome user experiences. I'm really good at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I know all about the latest web development tools and frameworks.

I'm an expert at making websites look great on any device and browser, and I know how to optimize their performance too. I've worked with diverse teams and always delivered top-notch projects on time. I'm constantly learning and keeping up with the latest trends and technologies in the industry.

I'm a problem-solver and a great communicator, which helps me collaborate effectively with stakeholders. I can understand their requirements and turn them into visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.
